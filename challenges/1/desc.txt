Welcome from Santa!

He has a little issue:

Lately he has been using computers to enhance the speed of his elves. But there's a slight issue.

Coding counts from 0, but he wants to count from 1 (who wants to get 0 presents).

Take a number, the number of presents Timmy will receive, and output that number + 1.

E.g. 

Input:

10

Output:

11 (which is 10 + 1)
