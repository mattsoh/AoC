Now, Santa needs you to add up piles of presents. He has too many! Enter the number of presents in each pile, separated by spaces:
For example, if you have three piles with 5, 10, and 15 presents, he will enter 

5 10 15

Help him then calculate the total number of presents to send!

In this case, it's just

30

Let's help Santa manage his presents!

Hint: use

presents = input().split()

Then run a for loop:

for present in presents:
    # Add int(present) to a count
